# The Internals of PySpark (Apache Spark {{ spark.version }})

Welcome to **The Internals of PySpark** online book! ðŸ¤™

I'm [Jacek Laskowski](https://pl.linkedin.com/in/jaceklaskowski), an IT freelancer specializing in [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) and [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) (with brief forays into a wider data engineering space, e.g. [Trino](https://trino.io/) and [ksqlDB](https://ksqldb.io/), mostly during [Warsaw Data Engineering](https://www.meetup.com/Warsaw-Data-Engineering/) meetups).

I'm very excited to have you here and hope you will enjoy exploring the internals of Spark SQL as much as I have.
